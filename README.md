# Personal Portfolio Website

A modern portfolio website created as a term project to showcase my skills and experience as an AI/ML Engineer and Software Developer. This project demonstrates proficiency in React.js, responsive design, and modern web development practices.

**Live Demo**: [https://animated-croissant-177628.netlify.app/](https://animated-croissant-177628.netlify.app/)

### Design Inspiration & References

After analyzing numerous portfolios, I drew inspiration from these exceptional examples:

1. **[Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/)** 
   - **What I Implemented**: Clean navigation bar with hover effects, smooth scrolling between sections, and the navy/teal color scheme
   - **Why**: Her minimalist approach and excellent code organization set the standard for professional developer portfolios

2. **[Soumyajit Behera](https://soumyajit.vercel.app/)**
   - **What I Implemented**: Project cards with technology tags, GitHub integration links, and mobile responsive grid layout
   - **Why**: As a fellow student his portfolio showed how to present academic projects effectively

3. **[Matt Farley](https://mattfarley.ca/)**
   - **What I Implemented**: Clear call-to-action buttons, simple contact section, and mobile-first design approach
   - **Why**: His portfolio proves that simple and well executed design can be more effective than complex animations

## Features

### Core Features
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between dark and light modes
- **Smooth Navigation**: Fixed navbar with smooth scrolling between sections
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, animations, and transitions throughout

### Advanced Features
- **Animated Canvas Background**: Floating particles using HTML5 Canvas API
- **Drag & Drop Skills**: Reorder skills by dragging them
- **SVG Visualizations**: Animated radar chart showing skill proficiency
- **Project Gallery**: Images with hover effects showing project demos
- **Custom Cursor**: Interactive cursor effect on desktop

## Technologies Used

- React.js (Hooks, State Management)
- CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, Custom Properties)
- HTML5 APIs (Canvas, SVG, Drag & Drop)
