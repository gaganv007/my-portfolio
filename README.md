# Personal Portfolio Website - Term Project

A modern portfolio website created as a term project to showcase my skills and experience as an AI/ML Engineer and Software Developer. This project demonstrates proficiency in React.js, responsive design, and modern web development practices.

## Project Overview

This portfolio was built as part of my coursework to create a professional online presence. I studied several outstanding developer portfolios and implemented the best practices I learned from them.

### Design Inspiration & References

After analyzing numerous portfolios, I drew inspiration from these exceptional examples:

1. **[Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/)** 
   - **What I Implemented**: Clean navigation bar with hover effects, smooth scrolling between sections, and the navy/teal color scheme
   - **Why**: Her minimalist approach and excellent code organization set the standard for professional developer portfolios

2. **[Soumyajit Behera](https://soumyajit.vercel.app/)**
   - **What I Implemented**: Project cards with technology tags, GitHub integration links, and mobile-responsive grid layout
   - **Why**: As a fellow student, his portfolio showed how to present academic projects effectively

3. **[Matt Farley](https://mattfarley.ca/)**
   - **What I Implemented**: Clear call-to-action buttons, simple contact section, and mobile-first design approach
   - **Why**: His portfolio proves that simple, well-executed design can be more effective than complex animations

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js (Hooks, State Management)
- **Styling**: CSS3 (Custom Properties, Grid, Flexbox)
- **Animations**: CSS Transitions and Transforms
- **Deployment**: Netlify
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaganv007/my-portfolio
cd my-portfolio
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server:**
```bash
npm start
```

4. **View in browser:**
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized build in the `build` folder.

## Responsive Design

The portfolio is fully responsive and works on:
- Desktop computers (1200px+)
- Tablets (768px - 1199px)
- Mobile phones (320px - 767px)

### Mobile Features:
- Hamburger menu for navigation
- Stacked layout for better readability
- Touch-friendly buttons and links
- Optimized images for faster loading

## Performance Optimization

Implemented several optimizations:
- Lazy loading for images
- Minimal dependencies to reduce bundle size
- CSS animations instead of JavaScript for better performance
- Semantic HTML for better SEO
  

## Future Enhancements

Ideas for improving the portfolio:
- Add a blog section for technical writing
- Add more interactive animations
- Include testimonials section
- Create detailed project case studies

## What I Learned

This project taught me:
1. **React Best Practices**: Using hooks effectively, managing state, and creating reusable components
2. **CSS Modern Techniques**: Grid layouts, custom properties, and responsive design
3. **User Experience**: Making navigation intuitive and content easy to scan
4. **Deployment**: Setting up continuous deployment with Netlify
5. **Code Organization**: Keeping code clean and well commented
